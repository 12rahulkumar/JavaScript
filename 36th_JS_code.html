    <h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

    <p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
        var answer1 = "It's alright";
        var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
        var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        answer1 + "<br>" + 
        answer2 + "<br>" + 
        answer3;
    </script>
    
    <h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

    <p>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</p>

    <p id="demo1"></p>

    <script>
        var x1 = 34.00;
        var x2 = 34;
        var x3 = 3.14;

        document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML =
        x1 + "<br>" + x2 + "<br>" + x3;
