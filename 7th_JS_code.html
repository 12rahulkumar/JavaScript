    <!-- 
    JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
    
    To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
    
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>

    You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

    The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.

    External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.
